This is a student project that was made at UNI during my second year. The code was written by me, and three other students. I have before uploading in too Git made some minor changes so it's easier to navigate and understand the code.

I am aware of the project having several bugs, but that's not something I plan on fixing in theÂ future.
Enjoy :)
